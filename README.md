# Artificial Intellegence

*This is not a complete repository, I am slowly uploading all of the projects I have done over the years to this page!*

Hi! I wanted to share a few AI projects that I have done over the last few years. The projects range from demensionality reduction to deep learning. Enjoy!

## Principal Component Analysis
Here is a project I did to learn about dimensionality reduction!

## Linear Regression
Here is an implementation of a linear regression. I did this project to understand the math behind regressions!
